Welcome to the Official App for Lysack Risk (or more commonly known as just risk)

As you are probably well aware, Lysack risk is a modified risk game superior in every way to the original.
Unfortunately it has taken a long time for this game to make its departure from the minds of the Lysack children
and into the larger world. It did this first through expansion into other risk comunities including the RPMBC 
ping-pong club and the CMU boys. It received mixed reviews. However, once clearer heads prevailed the demand for Lysack 
risk grew. As the founding members of Lysack risk we, the Lyscak sibling council, have taken it upon ourselves to create an 
online version Lysack risk. Although the game could not be perfectly transmitted to an online format (mostly due to 
inexperience in coding) we beleive this app captures the essense of the game. 

Any future updates to the rules will be passed through the council of siblings and be agreed upon during an official
council game session. 

I thank you for your interest in this endeavor.
